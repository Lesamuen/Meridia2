This is the code for a joke discord bot named Meridia, written in Python3.11 with Pycord.

It started with one single functionality, based on the famous "Meridia's Beacon" from the game The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim.
Everytime some reacted with or entered a message with the :touchesthebeacon: emote, the bot would join the user's voice call and call out "A NEW HAND TOUCHES THE BEACON".

From then on, many, many other joke features have been requested and added, to the point that now, the bot needs a version control system, a database, and a full code rework.
Hence, Meridia 2.

Current python library dependencies:
py-cord[voice]
py-cord[speed]
pynacl
dotenv (to hide bot token)
